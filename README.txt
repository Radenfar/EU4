EU4:
This folder comes with three programs for making EU4 a more interesting game to play for veterans.

Dependencies:
numpy -> 'python -m pip install numpy'
pandas -> 'python -m pip install pandas'
pyautogui -> 'python -m pip install pyautogui'

Now for the fun stuff:

eu4_games
----------------------
Eu4_games is a fun program to give you ideas for what and how to play if you're out of ideas.
Loading up you will get one of a few options, enter which ever number applies and it will give you a challenge to complete!

eu4_provinces
----------------------
This is a very useful tool for messing around with the eu4 world.
STEPS:
First of all, you can run any command over any area/region/continent etc.
Some useful commands might include:
'change_religion'
'add_core'
'own_core'
And so on.
MAKE SURE TO NOT ADD A SPACE WHEN INPUTTING THE COMMANDS. These must be just the commands themselves.
After entering a command and area, quickly tab back to eu4 and hold down the enter key in the command interface.
When you hold down the enter key, the program will write all the needed commands and holding the enter key will automatically run them.
This turns converting an entire continent into a matter of a few seconds holding down the enter key!

eu4_startup
----------------------
For those looking for an easy game, eu4 start up works similarily to eu4_provinces.
Instead of running custom commands, eu4_startup will run and quickly spurt out a few commands to really get you going in eu4.
Run the program and quickly tab back, holding down the enter key in the eu4 command interface as described above.
